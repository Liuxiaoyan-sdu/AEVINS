# AEVINS
Acoustic-Event-Visual-INertial System for Underwater Stable Positioning

A Robust Monocular Odimetry Framework Fusing Acoustic, Event Camera, and Inertial Sensors for Underwater Applications.

---

## 📖 Overview

We present AEVINS, a novel and robust monocular odometry system specifically designed for challenging underwater environments. Our framework innovatively fuses data from acoustic sensors, event-based cameras, and inertial measurement units (IMUs) to achieve stable and reliable positioning in underwater conditions where traditional vision-based methods often fail.
