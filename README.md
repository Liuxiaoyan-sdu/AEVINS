# AEVINS
A Monocular Odometry Framework Based on Acoustic, Event Camera, and Inertial Sensors for Stable Positioning.

---

## 📖 Overview

We present a novel and robust monocular odometry system that innovatively fuses data from **acoustic sensors**, **event-based cameras**, and **inertial measurement units (IMUs)** to achieve stable and reliable positioning in challenging environments.
